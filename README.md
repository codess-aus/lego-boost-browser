# Lego Boost in Browser

Control Lego Boost from the browser without any installations.

## Web Bluetooth API

Application uses [Web Bluetooth API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API) to communicate with Lego Boost. 

Web Bluetooth API works with __Windows, Mac, Linux__ and __Android__ devices with __Chrome__ and __Opera__ browsers. Unfortunately Apple iOS doesn't support Web Bluetooth. 

[Supported devices](https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/web-bluetooth/blob/master/implementation-status.md)
